	<string name="about_aokp_sgt7_about_title">About AOKP SGT7</string>
	<string name="about_aokp_sgt7_about_content">AOKP SGT7 was born due the fact there was no AOKP for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7inch GSM variants.
after getting it to compile with the SGT7 TE4M\'s device / vendor &#38; kernel code, there was finally an unofficial release for the GSM
variants.\n\n
AOKP SGT7 now is also available for the CDMA variants - as TeamKang (and KhasMek) decided not to release any more builds for the CDMA
variants, i decided it was only fair for the CDMA users to give them the ability to keep using updated AOKP builds on their devices too, but
also give them all the benefits of running the AOKP SGT7 builds.\n\n
AOKP SGT7 has since release become one of the most popular builds for SGT7 devices, has branched out on to the 3 major social networking
sites (press the links above to see the respective profiles / pages for AOKP SGT7), and has it\'s own website with downloads, releases, bug
tracker, FAQ and more.</string>
	      
	<string name="about_aokp_sgt7_features_title">AOKP SGT7 Features (that you won\'t find in AOKP)</string>
	<string name="about_aokp_sgt7_features_content">the main features of AOKP SGT7 are as follows:\n\n
- all builds are generally 1-2 days off the latest AOKP code before release\n
- device &#38; vendor files from CM / SGT7 TE4M member cdesai (modified for use on AOKP SGT7)\n
- HumberOS / SGT7 TE4M\'s kernel with overclocking / kernel tweaks, and a few extra governors thrown in\n
- fixes &#38; improvements for 7 inch tablets (by myself &#38; sbradymobile from the SGT7 TE4M)\n
- extra features not included in standard AOKP releases - generally ported from SGT7 TE4M builds\n
- AOKP SGT7 exclusive wallpapers\n
- apps from CyanogenMod builds to give the rom a \"complete out-of-the-box\" feel.\n\n
and finally - a list of features / improvements (most originally by sbradymobile - ported to AOKP by myself):\n\n
- FEATURE: Flipped Tablet system bar (with flipped NavRing)\n
- FEATURE: UMS start on notification click (skips over the UMS activation screen)\n
- FEATURE: Large Recent thumbnails for Tablets\n

- FEATURE: disable Auto Brightness for devices that don\'t have that feature\n
- FEATURE: Kernel Tweaks - GPU Overclock &#38; Touchscreen Clock control\n
- FIXED: NavRing layout fixed for 7inch tablets\n
- FIXED: TabletUI USB storage notification\n

CDMA testers ::\n\n
- dodgem2012\n
- RockRatt\n\n
also thanks to the following for helping this build get to where it is today, and contributing in their own ways:\n\n
yappoe - SGTABHI - mao_red\n\n
TeamKang - the creators of AOKP, without their hard work this build would never exist, and the reason you are using this build on your
tablets (see the About screen for a list of people behind it and further information on TeamKang).\n\n
CyanogenMod - the pioneers in android roms, and the team behind many of the supplementary apps included with AOKP SGT7, without CM the
android modding community would probably never be the same.\n\n
SGT7 TE4M - this build would not exist without the SGT7 TE4M\'s awesome work! they have done amazing work getting ICS and JB working
properly on our SGT7, and the SGT7 would never be the same without them, so for that thanks to the following:\n\n
cdesai - HumberOS - sbradymobile - jt1134 - eaut - red_rebel - angel_666 - koxudaxi - Technomancer</string>
